Sigfilter is based on Linux 5.11.2.

`task_struct` structure has been extended with additional field `sigfilter`, which holds a spinlock, a pointer to BPF program, as well as a boolean indicator, whether the attachment happened from a process in compability mode (32 bit on amd64).

Apart from addition of types and implementation of helpers required by the task, I implemented the logic of attaching programs and of the execution.

I employ the eBPF verifier to check if specific fields in the envirinment structure are accessed.

Main change loci:
- copy_process function, which initializes the BPF pointer and the spinlock,
- ptrace_request, which processes the requests of the tracer,
- force_sig_info_to_task, which executes the supplied BPF program,
- __ptrace_unlink, which removes the signal filter, when the process stops being traced.
